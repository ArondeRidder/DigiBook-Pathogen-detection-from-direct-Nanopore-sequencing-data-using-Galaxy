# DigiBook-Pathogen-detection-from-direct-Nanopore-sequencing-data-using-Galaxy
This workflow contains tools in order to proform the following analyses types. Checking the quality reports generated by FastQC and NanoPlot for metagenomics Nanopore data. Preprocessing the sequencing data to remove adapters, poor quality base content and host/contaminating reads. Performing taxonomy profiling indicating and visualizing up to species level in the samples. Identifing pathogens based on the found virulence factor gene products via assembly, identifing strains and indicate all antimicrobial resistance genes in samples. Identifung pathogens via SNP calling and build the consensus gemone of the samples. Relating all samplesâ€™ pathogenic genes for tracking pathogens via phylogenetic trees and heatmaps.
